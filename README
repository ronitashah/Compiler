Due date:
    2/13/2023 @ 11:59pm for test case
    2/15/2023 @ 11:59pm working code and report

Assignment:
~~~~~~~~~~~

(1) Answer the questions in REPORT.txt

(2) Add a test case (<csid>.fun, and <csid>.ok, less then 5000 characters each)

     - <csid>.fun contains the fun code
     - <csid>.ok contains the expected output

(3) Write a compiler for the language from p2 (with some limitations to
    be discussed and finalized during class)

(4) Make your generated program run as fast as possible.

The command line interface:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

./p3 <name>

The compiler (p3) reads a fun program from stdin and produces the compiled
output as x86-64 assembly to stdout.

You can compile the assembly to produce an executable

for example:

    ./p3 < t0.fun > t0.s
    gcc -o t0.run -static t0.s
    ./t0.run

The Makefile automates those tasks

File names used by the Makefile:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<test>.fun    -- fun program
<test>.s      -- the equivalent x86-64 assembly
<test>.run    -- the equivalent x86-64 executable
<test>.out    -- the output from running <test>.run
<test>.ok     -- the expected output
<test>.diff   -- difference between <test>.out and <test>.ok
<test>.result -- pass/fail
<test>.time   -- how long it took to run <test>.run
